# Blender FLIP Fluids

**MEMES Fluids** is a powerful liquid simulation plugin that gives you the ability to create high quality fluid effects all within [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), the free and open source 3D creation suite. Created by Ryan Guy and Dennis Fassbaender.

## FLIP Fluids Beta

The core fluid engine, a FLIP-based fluid solver, has been under development for over three years with over a year of development focused on tightly integrating the simulator into Blender as an addon. We are excited to announce that the **FLIP Fluids simulator** is now ready to enter a beta testing phase! **The beta will begin on February 13th**.

<h3>Whitewater Generation</h3>
Create awesome large scale fluid effects with the whitewater simulator. Generate and simulate millions of foam, bubble, and spray particles to give a sense of realism to large bodies of water.

<h3>Viscosity Solver</h3>
Use the high quality viscosity solver to accurately simulate thin silky-smooth liquids, thick fluids that buckle and coil, and anything in between.

<h3>Built-in Mesh Generation</h3>
The built-in mesher generates highly detailed meshes so that your fluid surface is render-ready immediately after simulation. This mesh generator is memory efficient and able to produce meshes containing millions of triangles without requiring massive amounts of RAM.

<h3>Fracture Modifier Support</h3>
Create interesting destruction simulations by using the FLIP Fluids addon with the Blender Fracture Modifier branch. The fluid engine is optimized to support fractured objects that may contain hundreds to thousands of individual pieces.

<h3>Excellent User Experience</h3>
The addon interface was designed with a focus on functionality and usability to create a comfortable workflow. View simulation progress, meshes, and statistics in real-time. Pause and resume simulation baking- even after a Blender crash. Create and manage your own preset settings. Quickly apply materials from the fluid material library.
